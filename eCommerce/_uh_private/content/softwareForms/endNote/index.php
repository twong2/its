            <h1>University of Hawaii Agreement Form for Use of EndNote Software for Windows and Macintosh</h1>
            <p>The University of Hawaii (UH) Information Technology Services (ITS) ("Licensee") has negotiated a site license contract with Autodesk, Inc. ("Licensor") for the UH System. By purchasing this license through ITS, you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement form, as well as Authodesk's end userlicense agreement ("Agreement"). If you do not agree to the terms of either Agreements, you must not install any Autodesk software obtained from the ITS Site License Office. Licensor may discontinue the license if the UH fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions of their Agreement.</p>
            <p>This site license is in effect for a maximum period of one (1) year ending June 30 of the current UH fiscal year. Licenses can be renewed annual thereafter. Certain exceptions may apply for departments that fall under different terms. Unless otherwise specified, (1) license is valid for only (1) computer.</p>

Upon termination of employment or student status at UH, all copies of the EndNote software obtained through the ITS site license must be uninstalled, and the media must be destroyed. USERs of this software on personally owned or UH owned workstations do so at their own risk. UH will not accept any responsibility or liability for any consequential damage or lost data resulting from the use of this software.</p>
            <p>USER agrees to use the software under this agreement only on a computer which is 1) owned or leased by the UH or 2) owned by the USER.

USER agrees that he/she will not reverse engineer or decompile the products. </p>
            <p>Upon the USER’s termination (as an employee), or if advised by ITS that the site license with the Licensor has been terminated, USER agrees to return to ITS or destroy at once, any and all copies of EndNote software in the USER’s possession (including all backups) and to forward written notice to ITS (2565 McCarthy Mall – Keller Hall 109, Honolulu, HI 96822) that all programs and materials containing the products have been destroyed or deleted from all computer libraries, storage and memory devices, and are no longer in use or usable.</p>
